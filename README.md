# TicTacToe
Simple Tic Tac Toe game using x's and o's

## How It Works:
It first starts by printing out a standard empty Tic Tac Toe board.  After it shows an example tic tac toe board using numbers (ie. 1 = the upper left, 2 = the upper middle, and 3 = the upper right).  It then prompts the user if they would like to be an x or an o.  After the user's selection, it will then prompt which block and the user answers with the corresponding number.  The user then plays the game with the computer who randomizes its turns.  After the user either wins or loses it will prompt if the user would like to play again.  The game will continue to run until the user wants to quit.
